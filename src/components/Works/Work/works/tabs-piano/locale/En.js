  Text: 'Once I woke up in the middle of night cause I got an idea: "what if tabs in browser were like the piano keys?". I wrote the thought down in Asana and got back to sleep.',
  Idea: 'In the morning I felt less enthusiastic about this idea until i realized that Google Chrome actually has hotkeys for changing tabs.
