import React from 'react';

export default () => (
  <div>
    <h1>
      Spectrum at browser bar
    </h1>
    <p>
      Usually we have feedback from browser bar, such as URL or its anchors, but in my experiment I try to show how typical browser bar will visualize sound spectrum.
    </p>
    <iframe
      width="100%"
      height="430"
      src="//www.youtube.com/embed/I1nMNR8ntHM"
      frameBorder="0"
      allowFullScreen
    />
  </div>
);
