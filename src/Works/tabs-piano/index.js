    <h1>Tabs as the piano keys</h1>
    <p>
      Once I woke up in the middle of night cause I got an idea: "what
      if tabs in browser were like the piano keys?". I wrote the
      thought down in Asana and got back to sleep.

    <p>
      In the morning I felt less enthusiastic about this idea until i
      realized that Google Chrome actually has hotkeys for changing
      tabs. The process of switching tabs resembles playing a piano
      and makes tabs a perfect musical instrument! Every tab has a
      music tone assigned. Seven tabs is one octave.
